This is a hardware implemented project using verilog designed to encrypt any message using AES and a key, in addition of decrypting the message using the same key

# Features

- Contains every module of AES in a seperate file
- Can Encrypt using keys of sizes 128, 192, 256 bits
- Contains a wrapper which has two outputs which are encryped correctly and decrypted correctly
- Contains port mapping to the DE1-SoC board
